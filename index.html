			<p>
				<img src="assets/images/Brad_Pitt_Fury_2014.jpg" alt="My Photo">Living in Austin sometimes is akin to being in a foreign country.  I heard all of these words that I was unfamiliar with: JQuery, MongoDB, CSS, React.js, Git, Laravel, amongs many others.  Wanting to be in this secret society using unique code words, a decision was made to go to coding boot camp.
			</p>
			<p>
			This program threw me into the deepend.  I was struggling to fight back to the surface to find the cool life giving oxygen that was desperately needed.  Hours spent on a computer screen, dozens of open windows and tabs, countless lectures all needed to gather the information that I craved.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am becoming Ubermensch.  My years of experience with traditional project management  combined with these newfound abilities give me the power necessary to crumble buildings with my mind, seduce the most wily interviewer, and the ability to stay in the great city of Austin.
